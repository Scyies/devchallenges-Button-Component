<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

Here's my solution for the challenge!

- You can find my demo [here](https://devchallenges-button-one.vercel.app/)
- What was your experience?
- It was a really interesting challenge, I decided to not use too many libraries that I often use such as tailwind to challenge further, and I really had a good time learning how to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- So as I pray, unlimited bug works

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Besides the stories to be completed, in the case of adding a icon the the button can go to the [googleIcons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and search for the icon you want, then you just need to pass one the startIcon/endIcon prop the name of the icon that comes in the isertin the icon section: ![print](https://i.imgur.com/HmGCEww.png).
This way you can easily change the icon to the one you need!

I also made the Storybook optional storie, you just need to run the storybook on your computer.
